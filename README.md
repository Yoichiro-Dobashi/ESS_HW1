## Project Title
Homework 1: Synthetic Seismograms for displacements, strains, and rotations
## Description
Homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic half-space occupying z ≥ 0 (free surface at z = 0). 
Density ρ, P-wave speed α, S-wave speed β.
Point source at ξ = (xs, ys, zs) with depth zs > 0.
General (time-dependent) moment tensor M(t) = [Mij(t)].
Receivers at the free surface x = (x, y, 0). 
Without considering reflection and phase change at the free surface.

Parameters are in the input.yaml

### Executing program
Under a python notebook environment
Execute with input.yaml
